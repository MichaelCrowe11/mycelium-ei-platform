# Mycelium EI Platform

Overview

The Mycelium EI Platform is a proprietary environmental intelligence solution combining AI, autonomous systems, and mycelium-based applications to monitor, predict, and mitigate environmental challenges in real time. It offers innovative tools for ecological restoration, carbon sequestration, pollutant breakdown, and sustainable development.

Features

Core Functionality
	•	Fungal Database: Houses a comprehensive collection of fungal strains with taxonomy, optimal growth conditions, and ecological applications.
	•	Simulation Framework: Capable of simulating ecological scenarios across up to 1,000,000 sites.
	•	Real-Time Analysis: Provides actionable insights with AI-driven predictions and visualization tools.
	•	Weather Forecast Integration: Models weather patterns to optimize strain deployment and ecosystem management.

Licensing System

The platform supports multiple licensing tiers with customizable features and restrictions:
	1.	Commercial License:
	•	Full database access, unlimited simulations, advanced visualization tools.
	•	Suitable for enterprise clients requiring scalability and integration.
	2.	Research License:
	•	Access to limited simulations and preconfigured visualization tools.
	•	Restricted to academic and non-commercial use.
	3.	Nonprofit License:
	•	Basic database access and limited visualization tools.
	•	Available for conservation projects with mandatory data sharing.
	4.	Open-Source Components:
	•	Access to limited datasets and algorithms.
	•	Requires attribution for derivative works.

Security Features
	•	Environment Variable Encryption: Protects API keys and sensitive data.
	•	Role-Based Access Control: Restricts features based on license tier.
	•	Data Integrity Checks: Ensures accurate and secure simulation results.

How to Use

Prerequisites
	•	Python 3.9+
	•	Required Python libraries: see requirements.txt

Installation
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repository/mycelium-ei.git
cd mycelium-ei


	2.	Create a virtual environment and activate it:

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate


	3.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt



Licensing Example

Add and validate licenses using the following code:

from priority_logic.licensing_logic import validate_license

user_license = "commercial"
license_features = validate_license(user_license)

print("License Features:", license_features["features"])
print("License Restrictions:", license_features["restrictions"])

Running Simulations
	1.	Set up environment variables in .env.
	2.	Run simulations using pre-built scripts:

python run_simulation.py


	3.	View results in the visualizations/ directory or export outputs to data/simulation_results/.
